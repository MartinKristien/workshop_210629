1700s
Nicole-Reine Etable de la Brière Lepaute was one of a team of human computers
who worked with Alexis-Claude Clairaut and Joseph-Jérôme Le Français de Lalande to predict the date of the return of Halley's Comet
They began work on the calculations in 1757, working throughout the day and sometimes during mealtimes
Their methods were followed by successive human computers.
They divided large calculations into "independent pieces, assembled the results from each piece into 
a final product" and then checked for errors.
 Lepaute continued to work on computing for the rest of her life, 
 working for the Connaissance des Temps and publishing predictions of solar eclipses.

1910s
During World War I, Karl Pearson and his Biometrics Lab helped produce ballistics calculations for the British Ministry of Munitions. Beatrice Cave-Browne-Cave helped calculate trajectories for bomb shells. In 1916, Cave-Brown-Cave left Pearson's employ and started working full-time for the Ministry. In the United States, women computers were hired to calculate ballistics in 1918, working in a building on the Washington Mall. One of the women, Elizabeth Webb Wilson, worked as the chief computer. After the war, women who worked as ballistics computers for the U.S. government had trouble finding jobs in computing and Wilson eventually taught high school math.
